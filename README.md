# Train_Time
Train Scheduler Homework Assignment , Week 7

 In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase database to host arrival and departure data.
 The name of the database the application writes to is called : trainTime.

 The end user can add a train to the Train schedule table by populating the fields in the "Add Train" form. 

 The fields that are added in the input form are: Train Name, Destination, First Train Time and frequency. 

The app will retrieves and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
